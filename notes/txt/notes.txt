SMP, NUMA, and SMT

Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)
    SMP is a design found in many modern multi-core systems. In an SMP system, there are two or more CPUs and these CPUs are connected by some interconnect. This provides CPUs with equal access to system resources like memory and input/output ports.
Non-uniform memory access (NUMA)
    NUMA is a derivative of the SMP design that is found in many multi-socket systems. In a NUMA system, system memory is divided into cells or nodes that are associated with particular CPUs. Requests for memory on other nodes are possible through an interconnect bus. However, bandwidth across this shared bus is limited. As a result, competition for this resource can incur performance penalties.
Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT)
    SMT is a design complementary to SMP. Whereas CPUs in SMP systems share a bus and some memory, CPUs in SMT systems share many more components. CPUs that share components are known as thread siblings. All CPUs appear as usable CPUs on the system and can execute workloads in parallel. However, as with NUMA, threads compete for shared resources.
